``PDFFonts``
============

This is a tiny program that uses Mac OS X’s PDF capabilities to list fonts
embedded in a PDF document.  It can be used as a replacement for the ``pdffonts``
utility found in most Linux distributions.


Installation
------------

Compile the code with the Xcode IDE or the ``xcodebuild`` command, and copy the
binary file ``build/Release/PDFFonts`` into any directory in your search path.


Usage
-----

::

    PDFFonts [options] [files]


Options
-------

-m  merge lists from all files, implies ``-U -N``
-M  don’t merge, the default
-r  don’t prettify font names, opposite of ``-R``
-R  remove everything up to first plus sign (garbage written by PDFTeX to
    create unique names), the default
-u  don’t sort the list, implies ``-M``
-U  sort the list, the default
-n  add header line for each file, implies ``-M``
-N  never add header lines
-a  add header lines if and only if more than one file was given
